# Optimizing-KNN-Classification-with-Systematic-K-Value-Selection
 In this, I implemented and optimized a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict outcomes, focusing on finding the optimal K value. By developing an algorithm to systematically evaluate different K values and their error rates, I fine-tuned the model for better accuracy and reliability, ensuring robust performance in various classification tasks.
